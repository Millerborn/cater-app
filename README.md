# Cater

Welcome to my project Cater. I built this application so people could get a high quality restaurant experience right at their home. A customer can see local chefs, hire them to cook a meal and pay and checkout. Customers create an account, enter and are able to edit their information, view cart updates with their order and when they're ready they can checkout.

## This project is built with

React, Redux, Material UI Node.js, Sagas, Stripe API, Moment.js, PostgreSQL, Express and React-Carousel

### Heroku site on the way!
