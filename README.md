# Cater

Welcome to my project Cater. I build this application to bridge the gap between people getting great food at restaurants and allowing them have that experience at home. A customer can see local chefs and hire them to cook their meal. Their cart updates with their order and when they're ready they can checkout using the Stripe API.

## This project is built with

React, Redux, Node.js, Sagas, Stripe API, Moment.js, PostgreSQL, Express and React-Carousel

## Setup

To use this repo, fork, clone or download this file.
Create a database 'cater' and tables using the `data.sql` file.

then
```
npm install
npm run server
```

after server is running
```
npm run client
```
